class Solution {
    public boolean containsDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                    int intcheck = nums[i];
                    for (int h = i+1; h < nums.length; h++) {
                        if (intcheck == nums[h]) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
                return false;
    }
}

I was able to figure out the above solution on my own.  After solving the problem, I looked at other solutions and learned about the "seen" function of Sets.  I was previously unfamiliar with the seen function.

Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
                for (int num : nums) {
                    if (seen.contains(num)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    seen.add(num);
                }
                return false;
