Wrote code after watching everything in video except the coding section.  The code to accomplish this task is not hard, but understanding the math to come up with the solution is hard.  I wrote the code quickly, but I don't really understand the math.

class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int[] output = new int[nums.length];
        int pre = 1;
        int post = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            output[i] = pre;
            pre = pre * nums[i];
        }
        for (int i = nums.length -1; i >= 0; i--) {
            output[i] = output[i] * post;
            post = post * nums[i];
        }
        return output;
    }
}
